   <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li><bold>Personal Background:</bold> I was born and raised in Dhaka, Bangladesh where I finished my highschool education. I moved to the US in 2021 for college where I began my bachelors here in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering and a Minor in Mathematics. However, coming to the US has been a life-changing opportunity for me in all aspects. Adapting to a new culture, new way of life with different sets of values and finally starting to live alone was quite adventurous for me and the road isn’t definitely smooth yet. It still has its ups and downs as I am learning each day to navigate my way around here with all the grace. 
    </li>
    <li><bold>Professional Background:</bold>I worked as a TA for Calculus I, Calculus II, Statistics-2122 here at UNCC and sadly that is all the professional experience I currently have. I am a full-time student and am trying to hone all the skills I can mostly while I am still a student.
    </li>
    <li><bold>Academic Background:</bold>I have finished my high school education in Bangladesh where I finished my schooling in a British patterned curriculum.</li>
    <li><bold>Background in this Subject:</bold>I honestly do not have much experience with HTML, CSS. However, I can do moderate programming in Java and Python.
    </li>
    <li><bold>Primary Computer Platform:</bold>Knowledge with Windows and macOS mostly.
    </li>
    <li><bold>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</bold>
    <ul>
        <li><bold>ITSC-3112-Dsgn & Imp Object-Oriented-Systems:</bold> This is a major requirement for my class
        </li>
        <li><bold>ITSC-3130-Human Centred Design:</bold> I wanted to have some knowledge of the Product Management sector too and this course is important for that

        </li>
        <li><bold>ITIS-3135-Web App Design and Development:</bold> In order to be a full stack developer I must have thorough knowledge of both front and backend technologies and this class teaches front end technologies.</li>
        <li><bold>ITCS-3050-Topics in Computer Science:</bold>This class is a research intensive course which would facilitate me with a lot of knowledge and contribute significantly to my learning curve.
        </li>






    </ul>
    
    
    </li>
    <li><bold>Funny/Interesting thing to remember me by:</bold> I have a profound love for anything mint. I love mint ice-cream and can finish an entire tub at a go. People mostly consider mint to be a toothpaste and find it kinda weird but I usually don’t.
    </li>
    <li><bold>I'd also like to share:</bold> I love clicking pictures of both nature and myself. I would like to get a DSLR someday when I can afford to do so.
    </li>
