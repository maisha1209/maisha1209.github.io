        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        <p>The CRAP principal helps to design a good website that is easily distinguishable from othe rwebsites. What is CRAP?</p>
        <p><strong>C</strong> (Contrast) <strong>R</strong> (Repetition) <strong>A</strong> (Alignment) <strong>P</strong> (Proximity)  </p>
        <h2><a href="https://www.allbirds.com/?irclickid=0aH1Wt33hxyPRBuWgCxeS2EHUkFW3zymN1ea1k0&irgwc=1&utm_campaign=Future%20PLC.&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=impact">Great Website -->allbirds.com </a></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>C</strong> - They used white background and different colours of image mainly black, red, blue and other dark and vibrant colours. These easily draw attention of viewers and creates an impression that they have a very standard and premium quality of apparel. They also designed in a manner to improve visibility and readability. </li>
            <br><li><strong>R</strong> - Colors, fonts, sizes of fonts, shapes on this website is same.</li>
            <br><li><strong>A</strong> - They have varying alignments throughtout their website; sometimes they have a centre alignment and sometimes to the left, but in all they made a good job maintaing consistency which seemed appealing to customers</li>
            <br><li><strong>P</strong> - Proximity was good enough too. Everything was well-spaced and things did not feel that they were cluttered on one page.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a href="http://www2.pnwx.com/">Bad Website --> pnwx.com</a></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>C</strong> - There was hardly any contrast. The background was dark-coloured itself and so was the text.So, as viewers it was hard to read the text as there was almost no visibilty..</li>
            <br><li><strong>R</strong> - They almost had no repetions throughout their website and the designs seemed all over the place.</li>
            <br><li><strong>A</strong> - Alignments seemed to be on the centre; however, the font style made it look a bit scattered.</li>
            <br><li><strong>P</strong> -Proximity was too close on this website which was very unpleasant to look at. </li>
